## What's the purpose of the index?

Index goals can vary. So should your methodology.

-   Reducing dimensions from many to one components
-   Developing a new variable for a regression models
-   Targeting localities for place-based interventions
-   Getting a regional overview of some phenomenon
-   Inform decision-making in resource-deprived settings

## The audience can & should change your methods approach.

-   City or regional planners assessing places for improvement
-   Clinic identifying blocks to target health promotion
-   Community residents identifying places for tree planting.
-   National hospital group seeking baseline of critical topic
-   Scientists hypothesizing SDOH as a moderator in model
-   Population spatial sampling for a randomized control trial

## üé© Conceptually-Driven Indices

Input variables & Standardize. Apply Weights. Sum or Multiply.

-   CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index
-   CDC/ATSDR Environmental Justice Index

**Pros & Pitfalls**

-   Facilitates criteria-based decision-making

-   Outcome highly sensitive to weighting selected

-   Models [***theorized** importance*]{.underline}; may not reflect actual underlying processes

## The **Social Vulnerability Index**

![The original SVI index and database was published by: Flanagan, B. E., Gregory, E. W., Hallisey, E. J., Heitgerd, J. L., & Lewis, B. (2011). A social vulnerability index for disaster management. *Journal of homeland security and emergency management*, *8*(1), 0000102202154773551792.](index-img/svi.png)

## The **Environmental Justice Index**

## üé£ Data-Driven Indices

Input variables. Run model(s). Derive index(ices) from output.

-   Areal Deprivation Index (via HRSA, extended by Kind et al)
-   Van Handel's HCV/HIV Vulnerability Index

**Pros & Pitfalls**

-   May uncover expected & unexpected associations due to underlying variation across variables

-   Interpretation may be challenging, and may not be generalizable

-   Sensitive to input data and methodology

## CHCV/HIV Vulnerability Index

## When Using an Index

![](index-img/regress.jpg)

## Spatial Scale & Geographer's Lament  

-   State and National-level comparison groups:

    -   Southern Illinois vs St Louis vs Chicago

    -   Impact of borders on outcomes, and distance thresholds

    -   Utility of understanding state- and county-policies

```{=html}

```
-   County-level indices will have limitations on interpretation at local scales.

```
-   More local isn't always better: ACS block group margin of error are unstable and not recommended for analysis
