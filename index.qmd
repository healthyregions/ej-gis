## What's the purpose of the index?

Index goals can vary. So should your methodology.

-   Reducing dimensions from many to one components
-   Developing a new variable for a regression models
-   Targeting localities for place-based interventions
-   Getting a regional overview of some phenomenon
-   Inform decision-making in resource-deprived settings

## The audience can & should change your methods approach.

-   City or regional planners assessing places for improvement
-   Clinic identifying blocks to target health promotion
-   Community residents identifying places for tree planting.
-   National hospital group seeking baseline of critical topic
-   Scientists hypothesizing SDOH as a moderator in model
-   Population spatial sampling for a randomized control trial

## Conceptually-Driven Indices

Input variables & Standardize. Apply Weights. Sum or Multiply.

-   CDC's Social Vulnerability Index
-   CDC/ATSDR Environmental Justice Index

**Pros & Pitfalls**

-   Facilitates criteria-based decision-making

-   Outcome highly sensitive to weighting selected

-   Captures *theorized importance*; may not reflect actual underlying processes
