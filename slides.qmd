## **Gaps, challenges, and critiques in current EJ GIS toollandscape**

*Fusi et al 2022:*

-   30 states had lack of definition of EJ community

-   Half of all states utilize ArcGIS

-   42% of states did not have health outcome data

-   56% of states had low data accessibility for EJ open government data

## **Resistance & Representations**

-   Both governmental and industry oppositions to screening tools (Zrzavy et al. 2022)

-   Indigenous inclusion and representation (Mullen et al. 2023, Faust 2021)

-   Rural representation (Williams et al. 2022, Faust et al. 2021)

-   How vulnerable communities are identified, ex. thresholds (Huynh et al 2024)

-   Race and racism as a factor (Bompoti et al. 2024, Lee 2021)

-   Data Accessibility and Data Quality (Fusi et al, Boda et al, Maantay et al, Nost et al. 2022, Sadd et al. 2015).
