## What's the tech framework in which we do Environmental Justice?

-   Insights often communicated with maps, data summaries, figures & plots

-   Used to better understand environmental challenges & advocate for improved policy and resources

-   Used by **communities impacted by environmental injustices**, as well as researchers & policy makers

-   Often made using top-down design and closed coding/tech infrastructures

## Place-based apps central to EJ work

-   Used to determine root causes of injustices

-   Incorporate grass-roots advocacy and community engaged connections

-   GIS-based approaches common, but not always!

-   Strong tradition of community-driven art & movements

## **Challenges & critiques in current EJ tool landscape**

*Fusi et al 2022:*

-   30 states had lack of definition of EJ community

-   Half of all states utilize ArcGIS

-   42% of states did not have health outcome data

-   56% of states had low data accessibility for EJ open government data

## **Resistance & Representations**

-   Governmental & industry oppositions to screening tools^1^

-   Indigenous inclusion and representation^2^

-   Rural representation^3^

-   How vulnerable communities are identified, ex. thresholds^4^

-   Race and racism as a factor^5^

-   Data Accessibility and Data Quality^6^

## **Grand EJ tech system challenges**

Challenges:

-   *Technical:* Data Silos, Data Integration + Varying Standards, Technical system cost & complexity, Sustainability

-   *People:* Disciplinary Silos & Hierarchies, Politics, Access to time, people, & technical resources

Modern web design using [service-oriented architecture]{.underline}, free and/or [open GIS]{.underline} tools, and [distributed data stream integration]{.underline} can be adapted to break free of many of these technical (and some of the "people") restrictions.

## **ChiVes: A Chicago EJ Application**

A mapping & data collaborative linking dozens of environmental and socioeconomic indicators at the neighborhood level in Chicago with 2 main goals:

1.  Integrate Data & Insights from Existing Environment + Air Quality Projects
2.  Enable Community Better Access, Use, and Generated Insights from the Data

With a new tech approach, can we do EJ work better?

#### Refactored as a new application in 2022, pieced from prior projects. Funded in late 2022 with support from NASA and DePaul collaboration.

## Dynamic Data Integration

**Adding data using central standards:**

-   [Contributors]{.underline}: Aggregate to tract level, add (non-spatial) content to a Google Sheet. Write metadata using a template. Submit a Google Form.

-   [Tech team:]{.underline} Review, integrate using a Google Sheet. Re-build app.

**Access data viz with map or community snapshots, or:**

-   Download as a CSV, Shapefile, or GeoJSON

-   Data dictionary and detailed metadata on site

## **ChiVes Data: Surface Temperature**

## Chives Data: Modeled PM 2.5 Pollution

## Engaging with EJ Communities Directly

Long process of trust-building, listening, and understanding.

-   Adding new data based on focus groups and discussions

-   Refining, editing, and upgrading existing features with sustainability in mind

-   Co-designing new features & approaches

-   Developing an interactive index builder
